\section{Introduction}
Artificial intelligence (AI) has closer scientific connections with philosophy than do other sciences, because AI shares many concepts with philosophy, e.g. action, consciousness, epistemology (what it is sensible to say about the world), and even free will.

\section{Ethics of AI} 
Artificial Intelligence ethics means  comprise a set of values, principles, and techniques which employ widely accepted standards of right and wrong to guide moral conduct in the development and deployment of Artificial Intelligence technologies

\section{Turing's "polite convention"}
Turing's "polite convention": If a machine behaves as intelligently as a human being, then it is as intelligent as a human being. The Dartmouth proposal: "Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.

\section{Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon’s physical
symbol system hypothesis}
Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon’s physical symbol system hypothesis: ”A
physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.

\section{ John Searle’s strong AI hypothesis}
John Searle’s strong AI hypothesis: ”The appropriately programmed computer
with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the
same sense human beings have minds.

\section{Hobbes’ mechanism}
Hobbes’ mechanism: ”For ’reason’ ... is nothing but ’reckoning,’ that is adding
and subtracting, of the consequences of general names agreed upon for the
’marking’ and ’signifying’ of our thoughts...”

\section{ Intelligence}
Is it possible to create a machine that can solve all the problems humans solve
using their intelligence? This question defines the scope of what machines could
do in the future and guides the direction of AI research. It only concerns the behavior of machines and ignores the issues of interest to psychologists, cognitive
scientists and philosophers; to answer this question, it does not matter whether a
machine is really thinking (as a person thinks) or is just acting like it is thinking.
\maketitle

\section{ Human thinking is symbol processing}
In 1963, Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon proposed that ”symbol manipulation” was the essence of both human and machine intelligence. they wrote;”A
physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.” and ”The mind can be viewed as a device operating on bits of
information according to formal rules.”
\maketitle

\section{Arguments against symbol processing
}
These arguments show that human thinking does not consist (solely) of high
level symbol manipulation. They do not show that artificial intelligence is impossible, only that more than symbol processing is required.
